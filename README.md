vim settings

My custom:
  vim setting,
  vim color coding,
  plugins,

I don use tabs, only spaces, in other words:tab generates an indent of two space.

Current version: 1.1
* Added pathogen and some extra plugins.
  Plugins:
    * Syntastic
    * tabular
    * vim-puppet
    * vim-stylus
    * New syntax: css
